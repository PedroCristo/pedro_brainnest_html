                    <h2> Would you rather use HTML or CSS, for putting paragraphs of text on a webpage? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> To add paragraphs of text to a webpage, you would use HTML. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> Would you rather use HTML or CSS, to change the font and background color of a button? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> To change the font and background color of a button, you would use CSS. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What is an HTML tag? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> An HTML tag is a code that is used to mark the beginning and end of an HTML
                        element. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What are the three parts of an HTML element? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> The three parts of an HTML element are the opening tag, the content, and the
                        closing tag. For example: &lt;p&gt;This is the content&lt;/p&gt; The opening tag is
                        &lt;p&gt;, the content is This is the content, and the closing tag is
                        &lt;/p&gt;.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What is the purpose of the doctype declaration? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> The purpose of the doctype declaration is to specify which version of HTML is
                        being used in the document. This allows the browser to interpret and render the HTML correctly.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What is the HTML element? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> The HTML element is the root element of an HTML document. It encapsulates all
                        of the content on the page, and serves as a container for the head and body elements. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What is the purpose of the head element? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> The head element is used to contain information about the document that is not
                        directly related to the content of the page. This includes things like the title of the
                        document, links to external stylesheets and scripts, and meta information such as keywords and
                        descriptions. The head element is represented by the &lt;head> tag and should be the first element 
                        within the HTML element.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What is the purpose of the body element? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> The body element is used to contain the content of the webpage that is visible
                        to the user. This includes text, images, and other HTML elements that make up the page. The body
                        element is represented by the &lt;body> tag and should be the second element within the HTML
                        element, after the head element.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> How do you create a paragraph in HTML? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> To create a paragraph in HTML, you can use the &lt;p> element. For example: </p>
                    <pre><code> &lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p> </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> How do you create a heading in HTML? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> To create a heading in HTML, you can use one of the heading elements: &lt;h1>,
                        &lt;h2>, &lt;h3>, &lt;h4>, &lt;h5>, or &lt;h6>. The heading elements range in size, with &lt;h1> 
                        being the largest and &lt;<h6> being the smallest. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code> &lt;h1>This is a heading&lt;/h1> </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> How many different levels of headings are there and what is the difference between them? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> There are six levels of headings in HTML, numbered from 1 to 6. The difference
                        between the heading levels is the relative size of the text. Heading level 1
                        &lt;h1> is the largest, and heading level 6 &lt;h6> is the smallest. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What element should you use to make text bold and important? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> To make text bold and important, you can use the &lt;strong> element. You can
                        also use the &lt;b> element for bold text, although the &lt;strong> element is considered more 
                        semantically correct as it indicates that the text is important. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code> &lt;strong>This text is important and bold.&lt;/strong> </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What element should you use to make text italicized to add emphasis to it? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> To make text italicized to add emphasis to it, you can use the &lt;em> 
                        element. You can also use the &lt;i> element for italicized text, although the &lt;em> 
                        element is considered more semantically correct as it indicates that the text should be 
                        emphasized. For example: 
                    </p>
                    <pre><code> &lt;em>This text is emphasized and italicized.&lt;/em> </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What relationship does an element have with any nested elements within it? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> An element that has other elements nested within it is called the parent
                        element, and the nested elements are called child elements. The parent element and child
                        elements have a parent-child relationship.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What relationship do two elements have if they are at the same level of nesting? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answe: </em> Two elements that are at the same level of nesting are called sibling elements.
                        Sibling elements have a sibling relationship.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> How do you create HTML comments? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> To create an HTML comment, you can use the <code>&lt;!-- and --&gt; tags. Anything you
                        write between these tags will be treated as a comment and will not be displayed in the final
                        webpage. For example: </p>
                    <pre><code> &lt;!-- This is an HTML comment --> </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What HTML tag is used to create an unordered list? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> To create an unordered list in HTML, you can use the
                        <code>&lt;ul>` element. This element represents an unordered list of items, 
                        which are typically displayedwith bullet points. For example: 
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code> 
                          &lt;ul>
                            &lt;li> Item 1 &lt;/li>
                            &lt;li> Item 2 &lt;/li>
                            &lt;li> Item 3 &lt;/li>
                          &lt;/ul>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What HTML tag is used to create an ordered list? </h2>
                    <p><em>Answer:</em> To create an ordered list in HTML, you can use the &lt;ol> element. This element
                        represents an ordered list
                        of items, which are typically displayed with numbers or letters. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                          &lt;ol>
                            &lt;li> 1 . Item &lt;/li>
                            &lt;li> 2 . Item &lt;/li>
                            &lt;li> 3 . Item &lt;/li>
                          &lt;/ol>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What HTML tag is used to create list items within both unordered and ordered lists? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> To create list items within both unordered and ordered lists in HTML, you can
                        use the &lt;li> element. This element represents a list item. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                          &lt;ul>
                            &lt;li> Item 1 &lt;/li>
                            &lt;li> Item 2 &lt;/li>
                            &lt;li> Item 3 &lt;/li>
                          &lt;/ul>
            
                          &lt;ol>
                            &lt;li> 1 . Item &lt;/li>
                            &lt;li> 2 . Item &lt;/li>
                            &lt;li> 3 . Item &lt;/li>
                          &lt;/ol>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What element is used to create a link? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer :</em> To create a link in HTML, you can use the &lt;a> element. This element represents a hyperlink, which allows users to 
                        navigate to another webpage or a specific location on the same webpage. For example: 
                    </p>
                    <pre><code> &lt;a href="http://www.example.com">This is a link&lt;/a> </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What is an attribute? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> An attribute is a property of an HTML element that provides additional
                        information about the element. Attributes are typically
                        specified in the start tag of an element and take the form of a name-value pair. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code> &lt;a href="http://www.example.com">This is a link&lt;/a> </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What attribute tells links where to go ?</h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> The "href" attribute tells links where to go. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What is the difference between an absolute and relative link? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> An absolute link specifies the full URL of a webpage or resource, while 
                        arelative link specifies the location of a webpage or resource relative to the current webpage.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> Which element is used to display an image? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> The "img" element is used to display an image. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What two attributes do images always need to have? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> Images always need to have the "src" attribute (which specifies the source file
                        for the image) and the "alt" attribute (which specifies alternative text for the image in case 
                        it cannot be displayed).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> How do you access a parent directory in a file path? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> You can access a parent directory in a file path by using "../" (without the
                        quotes). 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> What are the four main image formats that you can use for images on the web? </h2>
                    <p><em> Answer: </em> The four main image formats that you can use for images on the web are JPEG,
                        PNG, GIF, and SVG.
