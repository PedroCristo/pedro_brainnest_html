       <article>
           <p> In HTML, links and images are two important elements that allow us to connect and enrich our content. Links,
               or hyperlinks, allow us to navigate to other web pages or to specific locations within the same page. They
               are created using the anchor tag, (a), and the href attribute, which specifies the destination URL. Images,
               on the other hand, are used to display pictures and graphics on a web page. They are inserted using the
               (img) tag, which requires the src attribute to specify the image file's location. We can also use the
               alt attribute to provide a text alternative for the image, which is useful for accessibility purposes
               and for when the image is unable to be displayed. By using these elements effectively, we can create
               engaging and interactive content for our users.
